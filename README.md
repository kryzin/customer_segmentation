# Customer Segmentation

This project analyzes a customer analytics dataset to identify distinct **customer segments** based on demographics, spending behavior, and purchase frequency.  
The goal is to uncover actionable insights that could help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

The dataset can be accessed [on its Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasjigupta786/customer-analytics-practice-dataset).

## Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer data.  
- Engineer customer-level features (purchase frequency, total spending, recency, etc.).  
- Apply clustering techniques (KMeans, DBSCAN, GMM) to segment customers.  
- Profile each customer segment and extract business insights.  
- Build an interactive dashboard to explore clusters.
